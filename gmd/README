Git Mirror Daemon
=================

Small daemon which can be fed Git URLs via a network socket and then fetches
those repositories in mirror mode.

git-mirror-trigger.pl and git-mirror-trigger.sh are two example scripts which
are intended to be called as GitWebAdmin triggers (usually over SSH) to
maintain a mirror of git repositories.

Not to be confused with the git-mirror-daemon script which does something similar
on the GitWebAdmin server.
