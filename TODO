TODO
====

general
 * unify form validation by using Data::FormValidator or
   FormValidator::Simple (via DBIx::Class::Validate)
 * log configuration changes in database and provide
   notifications for configuration changes (Mantis#12081)

SQL/database backend
 * switch to versioned schema to allow easy upgrades
 * remove hardcoded database names and allow to use password
   authentication (currently most scripts assume ident
   authentication)
 * improve trigger handling (fire triggers on trigger
   configuration changes)

gitosis/git backend
 * allow renaming repositories (Mantis#12053)
 * investigate whether switching to gitolite would be useful
 * investigate whether a tighter backend integration would be
   useful
 * smarter deletions (e.g. handle empty repos)
 * handle UTF-8 in diffs/logs correctly in notification mails
   (Mantis#13243)
 * more flexible forks & mirrors handling (e.g. allow to create
   mirrors as forks of other mirrors) (Mantis#12083)

mantis integration
 * remove commits->branch mappings, makes no sense
 * make more general to allow adding support for other BTS

frontend
 * split paths in repo lists
 * don't use multiselect boxes, requires too much concentration
   for users. use widgets that allow to easily add or remove one
   element
 * add confirmation dialogs for invasive changes (e.g. delete repository)
 * add UI for ACL handling
 * allow to manage users via UI
