DESCRIPTION

GitWebAdmin is an administration tool for a git server hosting
multiple Git repositories. It stores all the configuration in a
SQL database (PostgreSQL is the only database currently supported). It
includes a web interface to edit the configuration and several tools
to use the configuration to write configuration and data files for
other components of the Git server. It also includes hooks to use in
the hosted Git repositories for advanced features.

Read INSTALL for more information on setting up GitWebAdmin.
