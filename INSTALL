INSTALLATION

This is very basic, but it should give you a first idea where
to start.

 1) Create a postgres database and initialize it with setup/init.sql
 2) Install gitosis
 3) Check out the gitosis-admin repository
 4) Edit gitwebadmin.ini
 5) Start bin/git-adm-daemon. It will edit the gitosis.conf and push
    the result.
 6) Populate the users table in the database. There is currently no
    UI for this. bin/update_user_list is an example that uses an
    LDAP database to generate the user list.
 7) Configure your web server. GitWebAdmin assumes that the web server
    handles the authentication and leaves the username in REMOTE_USER
    environment variable.
    FIXME: add example configuration(s) to gwa repository
 8) Start the remaining utility daemons and scripts. See setup/crontab
    for a list and example configuration.
